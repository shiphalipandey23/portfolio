             <h2>About Me</h2>
             <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate and skilled individual with a background in software engineering (developer).</p>
             <p>Thank you for giving me this chance to introduce myself.<br>

                I'm shiphali pandey, from Balrampur, Uttar pardesh.<br>

                Currently, I'm pursuing a MCA at shri ramswaroop memorial univercity lucknow, and I'm in my
                final year
                with an outstanding aggregate of 70%.<br>

                I completed my schooling at kendiriya vidyalaya in Balrampur. When it comes to my
                personality, I am
                self-motivated, self-focused, well-organized, and possess excellent time management
                skills.<br>

                Moreover, I work well under pressure and consider myself a good listener, always eager to
                broaden my
                perspective through others' insights.<br>

                Recently, I had the opportunity to intern at internlight, where I contributed as a UI
                designer, building
                the next-generation user interface to overcome the flaws of the existing one.<br>

                Additionally, I worked on an attendance system using facial recognition, matching incoming
                faces with
                stored images to mark attendance in an Excel file.<br>

                Beyond academics, I have a passion for handball and even won the first prize in a match held
                at our
                school.<br>

                My hobbies include traveling and writing enabling me to express myself in a unique and
                inspiring
                way.<br></p>
